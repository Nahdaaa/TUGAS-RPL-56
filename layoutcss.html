  <h2>The Renin-Angiotensin System, 
      Hypertension, and SARS-CoV-2 Infection: a Review</h2>
  <p>Recent findings: There is currently no data in support of the concerns 
      raised with the use of ACEIs/ARBs. Many researchers have voiced concerns 
      that the use of ACEIs and ARBs may increase tissue ACE2 levels. 
      These researchers therefore recommend that individuals on ACEIs/ARB's medications withhold such antihypertensive drugs, 
      unless advised by their physicians to do so. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors as the port of entry to human hosts. 
      ACE2 and ACE are different enzymes and ACE inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2. 
      Therefore, the use of ARB's or ACEIs should not be discontinued if an individual is infected by SARS-CoV-2. 
      Further studies are required to investigate the effect of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression and COVID-19.</p>
